# human-motion-recognition-IMU
This project uses Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques to classify different types of human motion (e.g., walking, sitting, running, standing). The goal is to build accurate models that can detect human activities in real time.
